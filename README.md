# Vancouver-or-raincouver?
Well, Well, Well! Vancouver has officially transformed to Raincouver. As of September 18th, the weather has started going overcast, damper and colder. Are we all in for the rainy drainy vancouver weather??

Do I despise the rainy Vancouver weather? or do I like the rainy Vancouver weather? 

I am kind of midway there, sometimes I like, sometimes I don't, a bit moody it seems. 
Nevertheless, I am building some data engineering skills. Data Engineering Yeah!!

## Data Engineering

One of the core skillsets sought in a data engineer is that they must be able to **design**, **build** and **maintain** automated **Extract, Transform & Load** data pipelines. 

Now, for all those sliding down into this rabbit hole for the first time, **ETL** pipelines are exactly what their name suggests: 

1. Extact data from a source location.
2. Make useful transformations / Apply business logic to the data.
3. Store the transformed data into a target location.

## Problem and Data Engineering

How is rainy, drainy Vancouver related to the data engineering heps. Well weather is weather, right? But, well weather is seasonal, has clear patterns and there is a lot to gain from understanding weather patterns. Even in my own case, I want to know roughly when the vancouver rain starts consistently, and when it stops. For that I can look at the weather pattern in the last ten years and make some claims by taking the mean of the onset of the rain in the last ten years.
